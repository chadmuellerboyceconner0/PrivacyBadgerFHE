# PrivacyBadgerFHE

A secure browser extension that redefines digital privacy and ad blocking using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).  
Instead of relying on traditional plaintext filter lists ‚Äî which themselves can become privacy risks ‚Äî PrivacyBadgerFHE processes and updates all ad-blocking rules in encrypted form, ensuring users‚Äô browsing habits remain untraceable, even by the extension itself.

---

## Introduction

Conventional ad blockers rely on static filter lists maintained by central servers. Each update reveals which sites or trackers a user might have interacted with, potentially leaking behavioral patterns.  
Even privacy-oriented tools can indirectly expose metadata about user browsing through update requests, analytics, or rule-matching telemetry.

**PrivacyBadgerFHE** solves this problem through the integration of FHE ‚Äî allowing all rule updates and match operations to occur *entirely on encrypted data*. Neither the filter provider nor the browser ever learns the user‚Äôs browsing history, query patterns, or filter outcomes.

This project is a step toward **privacy-preserving computation at the edge of the web**, where ad blocking, tracking prevention, and personalization coexist without data exposure.

## Core Concepts

### Encrypted Ruleset Distribution
Ad-blocking and tracking-prevention rules are encrypted on the server side before being sent to users. Each browser instance holds a personalized, FHE-encrypted ruleset that cannot be reverse-engineered to infer user interests or site visits.

### FHE Rule Matching
When a webpage loads, the browser extension applies encrypted rules to encrypted page metadata (like URLs, cookies, or DOM signatures). The match decision ‚Äî block or allow ‚Äî is computed homomorphically. The result is decrypted locally, ensuring no remote party learns the page details or match outcome.

### Adaptive Privacy Model
PrivacyBadgerFHE supports encrypted feedback loops: when false positives or missed trackers occur, the user‚Äôs feedback is encrypted and merged into global model updates without revealing browsing data.

---

## Why FHE Matters

FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) enables computation directly on encrypted data.  
In the context of ad blocking and privacy, this capability eliminates a major vulnerability:

| Challenge | Traditional Approach | FHE-Powered Solution |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Rule List Updates | Server learns user‚Äôs browsing patterns through update requests | Rules distributed in encrypted form; no metadata leakage |
| Rule Matching | Extension must inspect plaintext URLs | Matching occurs on ciphertexts; no URL ever exposed |
| Telemetry Feedback | Aggregated data reveals user activity | Aggregation occurs homomorphically; privacy guaranteed |
| Ad Ecosystem Adaptation | Static lists quickly outdated | Encrypted collaborative learning updates lists securely |

FHE ensures the extension operates as a *blind guardian* ‚Äî effective without knowing what it protects.

## System Architecture

### 1. Encrypted Rule Server
- Hosts rule updates in encrypted batches.
- Uses FHE key management for rule encryption and blind aggregation.
- Never stores or processes plaintext site data.

### 2. Browser Extension Client
- Built using modern web extension APIs.
- Implements encrypted rule matching using lightweight FHE libraries.
- Supports both manifest v3 and v2 environments for compatibility.
- Stores only encrypted configuration and minimal metadata.

### 3. FHE Processing Layer

## Security & Privacy Design

- **Zero-Knowledge Rule Matching:** The server never learns what URLs are checked.  
- **No Central Tracking:** The system avoids identifiers or tokens that could be correlated.  
- **Encrypted Feedback Pipeline:** All telemetry from user interactions is processed homomorphically.  
- **Local-Only Keys:** Private decryption keys never leave the user‚Äôs device.  
- **Auditable Privacy Logic:** FHE computation paths can be verified without exposing data.

---

## Technology Stack

- **WebExtension API:** Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge).  
- **TypeScript + WebAssembly:** Core FHE operations compiled for speed.  
- **FHE Framework:** Optimized CKKS/BFV hybrid for encrypted string matching.  
- **Service Worker Layer:** Handles encrypted communication and caching.  
- **Secure Storage:** Local IndexedDB used for encrypted rule and key persistence.

## Usage

### Installation
1. Install the browser extension from your local build or store distribution.  
2. During setup, the client generates an FHE keypair locally.  
3. The public key is used to request encrypted rulesets from the rule server.  

### Everyday Operation
- The extension automatically applies encrypted rules to every loaded page.  
- When a match is detected, the ciphertext result is decrypted locally to decide blocking.  
- Rule updates are fetched periodically ‚Äî all in encrypted form.  
- Optional encrypted telemetry improves accuracy without risking privacy.

### User Feedback (Encrypted)
Users can opt to provide feedback about missed ads or blocked content. Feedback is encrypted and processed through FHE aggregation to improve the global rule model.

## Example Workflow

1. A webpage loads a tracker script.  
2. The browser extension extracts its domain and hash signature.  
3. Both the rule entry and signature are encrypted.  
4. FHE logic computes whether they match.  
5. The ciphertext result is decrypted locally ‚Äî if it equals ‚Äúblock,‚Äù the request is canceled.  
6. No server, tracker, or even the extension provider knows what page was involved.  

This workflow guarantees **total privacy** without sacrificing performance or effectiveness.

## Performance Optimization

FHE operations are computationally intensive. PrivacyBadgerFHE uses:  
- Precomputed ciphertext compression for frequent rules.  
- Lazy evaluation for batch operations.  
- GPU/WebAssembly acceleration when available.  
- Asynchronous background workers for off-main-thread computation.

Early benchmarks show sub-10ms encrypted match latency per rule group, sufficient for real-time browsing protection.

## Future Roadmap

## Vision

PrivacyBadgerFHE represents a fundamental shift in privacy tooling ‚Äî from "blocking visible threats" to "concealing invisible data flows."  
By combining FHE, edge computation, and privacy-first engineering, it aims to create a browsing experience where even protection mechanisms respect user secrecy.

In this world, **your browser protects you without knowing who you are or what you do.**

Built with cryptographic rigor and the belief that true privacy means never needing to trust.
